Applying a filter for a specific region would indeed narrow down the data to new hires from that region, potentially reducing the total number of new hires reflected in the summaries and other visualizations like the \"New Hires by Month and FPDesc\" line chart. In addition, filtering by region might reveal new trends or insights specific to that region, such as whether certain months had unusually high or low hiring rates or if there's a significant difference in the Full-Time vs Part-Time hiring trends within that region.\n",

This type of interaction, known as \"cross-filtering\", allows the dashboard to dynamically update other visualizations based on the selection. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here's what typically happens when you perform such an action in a PowerBI dashboard:\n",

      "- **Consistency Across Visualizations**: Other visualizations on the dashboard that are related to the selected attribute (in this case, region) will automatically adjust to reflect this narrower scope of data.\n",
      "- **Highlight vs. Filter**: In some cases, instead of filtering, PowerBI might highlight the selected data across other visualizations while still showing the context of unselected data in a more subdued manner. This action provides a clear visual emphasis on how the selected data stands in relation to the whole dataset.\n",
      "- **Insight Discovery**: Through this process, you might discover new insights. For example, the trend of hiring (e.g., more Full-Time or Part-Time hires) in the selected region might stand out or vary significantly from the overall data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that you have a good understanding of basic interactions within a PowerBI dashboard, you can experiment further with different elements and explore how they interconnect to provide comprehensive insights.

Here are several insights you might want to look for and how to potentially uncover them using the dashboard's functionalities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Trends Over Time**:\n",
      "   - **Exercise**: Use the \"New Hires by Month and FPDesc\" line chart to observe how new hires (both Full Time and Part Time) have varied over different months.\n",
      "   - **Insight**: Identifying patterns or trends, such as specific times of the year when hiring spikes or drops, can help in planning future recruitment efforts more effectively.\n",

      "   - **Exercise**: Utilize the \"New Hires by Region and Ethnicity\" bar chart along with the Region filter to compare hiring numbers across different regions.\n",
      "   - **Insight**: Understanding which regions have higher or lower hiring rates may reveal the effectiveness of regional strategies or indicate areas for potential expansion or reevaluation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Diversity in Hiring**:\n",
      "   - **Exercise**: Apply the Ethnicity filter and examine the visualizations to assess how diverse the new hires are in terms of ethnicity.\n",

      "   - **Exercise**: Investigate the line chart comparing Full Time vs Part Time hires over time and across regions.\n",
      "   - **Insight**: Analyzing the balance between Full-Time and Part-Time hires can offer insights into workforce flexibility, cost efficiency, and whether the current strategy aligns with operational needs.\n",

      "   - **Exercise**: Explore the summaries and clustered bar chart for insights on \"New Hires and New Hires Same Period Last Year\" across different categories.\n",
      "   - **Insight**: Identifying areas of growth or decline year-on-year can help in understanding the effectiveness of hiring practices and strategizing for sustainable growth.\n",

      "**Questions to Ask**:\n",
      "- Are there any observable cyclical trends in hiring that the company can prepare for?\n",
      "- How does the distribution of new hires (in terms of region, full/part-time, ethnicity) align with the company's strategic goals?\n",
